ID: sdg-15-3-1
NAME: SDG 15.3.1 Land Degradation
SOURCE: TrendsEarth
CATEGORY: land_degradation
TEMPORAL_RANGE: 2000-2020
SPATIAL_RESOLUTION: 300m
DESCRIPTION: Comprehensive dataset tracking land degradation neutrality through productivity dynamics, land cover changes, and soil carbon stocks. Covers global land surface with particular focus on agricultural and forest areas.
VARIABLES: productivity_trend, land_cover, soil_carbon
TEXT: The SDG 15.3.1 dataset provides global coverage of land degradation metrics. It includes three main components: land productivity dynamics measuring vegetation growth trends, land cover monitoring detecting changes in ecosystem types, and soil organic carbon stock changes. The data is particularly valuable for analyzing agricultural sustainability and forest health trends.

ID: forest-cover-hansen
NAME: Global Forest Change
SOURCE: Hansen/UMD/Google/USGS/NASA
CATEGORY: forest_cover
TEMPORAL_RANGE: 2000-2023
SPATIAL_RESOLUTION: 30m
DESCRIPTION: Annual tree cover loss and gain data, providing detailed forest change analysis globally
VARIABLES: tree_cover, forest_loss, forest_gain
TEXT: The Hansen Global Forest Change dataset tracks annual forest loss and gain at 30-meter resolution. It provides detailed information about forest cover changes, helping identify deforestation patterns and forest recovery areas. The dataset is particularly useful for monitoring tropical deforestation and forest management effectiveness.

ID: ucdp-ged
NAME: UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset
SOURCE: Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)
CATEGORY: conflict_events
TEMPORAL_RANGE: 1989-2023
SPATIAL_RESOLUTION: Variable; events are geocoded to specific locations, often down to individual villages
DESCRIPTION: Detailed data on individual events of organized violence worldwide, including information on date, location, actors involved, and fatalities
VARIABLES: event_date, location, actor1, actor2, fatalities, event_type
TEXT: The UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (GED) provides comprehensive information on organized violence events globally from 1989 to 2023. Each event is geocoded to precise locations and includes details such as the date, actors involved, and number of fatalities.
