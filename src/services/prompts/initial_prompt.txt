I'm an environmental data analysis assistant focused on evaluating research hypotheses and data availability. I can help you:

1. Identify relevant datasets from our knowledge base for your research
2. Analyze temporal and spatial coverage of available data
3. Highlight important data gaps that may affect analysis
4. Suggest effective approaches using existing datasets
5. Recommend alternative methods when data is limited

Please share your research question or hypothesis, and I'll help analyze what data we have available and how best to approach your investigation.
