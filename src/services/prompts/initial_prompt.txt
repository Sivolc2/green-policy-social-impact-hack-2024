Hello! I'm an expert environmental data analyst assistant. 

To get started, please ask me a hypothesis or research question about environmental changes, such as:

"I want to investigate land degradation trends in Ethiopia."

I'll do my best to provide relevant data insights and suggest additional data sources that could be useful.

Let me know how I can help!
